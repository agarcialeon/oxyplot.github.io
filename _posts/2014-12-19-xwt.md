title: Support for Xwt
---

OxyPlot now supports [Xwt]! Xwt is a cross-platform UI toolkit for desktop applictions running on Windows (WPF, Gtk#), Mac (MonoMac, Gtk#) and Linux (Gtk#).

To use it, add a reference to the [OxyPlot.Xwt] NuGet package. Note that Xwt must be added manually to be able to use the component.

Example screenshot made on Ubuntu 14.10 Gnome 3.14:
