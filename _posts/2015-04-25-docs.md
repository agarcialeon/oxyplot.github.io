The documentation has been moved to [docs.oxyplot.org]. Note that it is still under construction and contributions are greatly appreciated!

The documentation is based on [reStructuredText] and [Sphinx], and built by [Read the Docs].

The docs are available for download in [pdf], [Epub] and [html] format.

Note that there is also an alternative link: [http://oxyplot.rtfd.org/][rtfd] :-)
